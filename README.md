## Project Status: Archived

This project is no longer in development.  
All progress on **Flipi** has unfortunately been lost due to a series of hardware failures and personal setbacks.

Below is the final statement from me, originally posted in response to issue 1:

> Sorry for the late everything, and lack of information.  
>  
> I've been quite unlucky with this project, and there have been a few issues I've run into. First of all, multiple hard drives in my NAS died, and I lost all my progress on Flipi.  
>  
> After that, I tried to rebuild the project from scratch, but then my Flipper got stolen at an airport.  
>  
> All progress on this project has unfortunately been halted as I've lost my hardware to test it on. I can't exactly buy a new Flipper, as I'm a broke high-school student with no real source of income.  
>  
> Thanks to everyone who was interested in this project, and I'm truly sorry for not being able to produce a release of it.  
>  
> Until I can get my hands on a Flipper, this project is dead.

## Thank You

Thank you to everyone who followed, contributed to, or showed interest in **Flipi**.  
Your support meant a lot throughout its short development.
